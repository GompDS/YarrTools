# YarrTools
Tools for Church Guard's YARR (Yet Another Repo Reloader).

How to use:

1. Place the YarrTools folder in the YARR folder in your mod folder.
2. Paste the path to your Dark Souls 3 game directory into GameDirectory.ini.

NOTE: This has not been tested with ModEngine 2, but it probably works.

## YarrToMap
